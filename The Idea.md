Two stages of this entire thing:
1. Stage Usage of my general knowledge base whenever I research anything, a specific technology, a concept, or anything else I can dump my notes in here.
2. Stage Start a Structured approach to all of this. Order pages in a logical manner

Each page should contain
	A Level of confidence / done-ness
	Information about peer-review status 
	Refrences to allow further reading about the topic


Goals:
	This is not a book, this is supposed to be a resource to quickly get the idea for concepts.
